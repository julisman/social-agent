# Two independent checks:
#   post   — platform:post_id, never expires. Never reply to a post twice.
#   author — platform:@handle, 30-day window, checked across ALL brands.
#            Three different businesses replying to one person is the clearest
#            bot signal we can emit, so the author set is deliberately global.
