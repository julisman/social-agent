# Platform notes

Per-platform UI behavior. **Keep this file updated as you learn** — every session that
hits a surprise should leave a note here. These UIs change without warning, and this
file is the difference between a smooth run and rediscovering the same quirk monthly.

## Threads — the primary channel

**Why it's first:** genuine keyword search with a **Recent** sort. Text-first, so intent
is in the post itself rather than buried in a video. Highest leads-per-minute of the
three by a wide margin.

Verified working 2026-08-09. The site is `threads.com` (`threads.net` redirects). UI
language is Indonesian on these accounts.

### Search by URL — don't click the tabs

Navigate straight to the sorted results; it saves a click and a page settle each time.

```
Recent:  https://www.threads.com/search?q=<url-encoded>&serp_type=default&filter=recent
Top:     https://www.threads.com/search?q=<url-encoded>&serp_type=default
```

Both tabs are worth a pass, and they behave differently:

- **Recent** (`Terbaru`) — mostly sellers. The same rental accounts repost ads several
  times a day, so expect ~60% competitor noise and a handful of real buyers.
- **Top** (`Terpopuler`) — far better *buyer* posts, but most are 8-23 days old and die
  on the 7-day rule. Budget one usable lead per pass.

### Extraction recipe — two calls per query

1. `get_page_text` → author, relative age, and full post text for every result
2. `find` with the query **"post permalink timestamp links"** → returns author, exact
   timestamp, and `href` (`/@handle/post/<POST_ID>`) for each

`get_page_text` alone gives no URLs, and `find` alone gives no post text — you need
both. Scroll 2-3 times with a wait between before capturing to load more than the first
~8 results.

If `find` returns links without `href`, re-run it with a narrower query naming the
author ("timestamp permalink link inside <handle>'s post").

**When `find` is unavailable, use `read_page` with `filter:"interactive"`.** Learned
2026-08-11, when `find` failed all session on an API rate limit. `read_page` is not
model-backed, so it keeps working, and the accessibility tree contains the same
`/@handle/post/<POST_ID>` hrefs. It is a drop-in substitute for step 2.

Two caveats:

- **The tree only holds what is rendered.** Threads virtualises long lists and *unloads*
  posts as you scroll past them, so a permalink visible in `get_page_text` may be absent
  from the tree. Scrolling back can blank the column entirely — don't fight it.
- **Better: pin the post with an author-scoped search.**

  ```
  https://www.threads.com/search?q=<term>&from_author=<handle>&serp_type=default
  ```

  The target post comes back first, with its permalink, no scrolling. This also doubles as
  **the cheapest way to audit what our own account has replied to** — run it with
  `from_author=motorin.bali` and every reply shows under the post it answers, which is how
  the unlogged manual replies were found on 2026-08-11.

### Replying — the composer trap

**Clicking the inline reply box sometimes opens a "Utas baru" (new thread) composer on
top of the reply composer instead of focusing it.** Typing then goes nowhere visible and
submitting would publish a brand-new public thread from the account — content creation,
which this project must never do.

So, every time:

1. Click the `Balas ke <handle>...` box
2. Type
3. **Screenshot and read it before submitting** — non-negotiable
4. If a modal titled **"Utas baru"** is showing, click **"Batal"** (top-left). The
   composer underneath is the correct one — it quotes the target post and is headed
   **"Balas"**. Click into its input, retype, screenshot again, then send.

Submit is the **↑ arrow** on the inline box, or **"Kirim"** in the modal composer.

### Confirming a reply landed

A toast reads **"Diposting"**, and the post's comment count increments (15 → 16). Check
the count — the toast alone can appear while the reply is filtered. If the count doesn't
move, treat it as a suppression signal, don't retry, and run `social-health`.

### Direct messages — this is the real inbox

**Threads DMs matter far more than Instagram DMs for this business.** Measured
2026-08-09: Instagram had 6 threads, none of them live inquiries. Threads had 20+
threads and **four active rental inquiries that same morning**. Check Threads first,
not Instagram, regardless of what the general platform table says.

```
Inbox:   https://www.threads.com/messages/       ← /inbox 404s, don't guess it
Thread:  https://www.threads.com/messages/t/<thread_id>
```

Two tabs: **`Kotak Masuk`** (inbox) and **`Permintaan`** (requests).

**Inbound inquiries from strangers land in Permintaan and must be accepted before you
can reply.** Accepted threads show a system line: *"Anda menerima permintaan pesan
dari X"*. Accepting is the account owner's call, not the agent's — it also lets the
sender call the account and see activity status. Surface it, don't click it.

Composer is `Pesan...` at the bottom; send is the **paper-plane button** to its right.
Sent messages appear right-aligned with a timestamp; `Dilihat` under one means seen.

Timestamps in the thread list are relative (`14 menit`, `2 jam`, `1minggu`) and refer to
the **last message in the thread**, which may be outbound — don't read "2 jam" as "they
messaged 2 hours ago" without opening it.

### Comments on our own posts — verified 2026-08-11

`Aktivitas` in the sidebar defaults to **`Semua`**, which is mostly `Saran utas`
(suggested threads) — other people's viral posts, not our notifications. It is noise and
it buries the few real items.

**Filter it.** Click the `Semua ▾` dropdown next to the `Aktivitas` heading and pick
`Balasan`. That lands on a stable URL you can navigate to directly next time:

```
Replies to us:  https://www.threads.com/activity/replies
Mentions:       Penyebutan in the same dropdown
```

Other dropdown options: `Mengikuti` · `Balasan` · `Penyebutan` · `Kutipan` ·
`Postingan Ulang`.

Reading the `Semua` list, note that a **pink heart badge on the avatar means a like**, and
the text shown beside it is *our* post or reply that they liked — not something they wrote.
Misreading that turns our own outbound copy into an imaginary inbound comment.

Entries reading **"Balasan Anda dilihat lebih dari 50 kali"** are reach notifications on
our own replies, not comments needing an answer.

### Gotchas

- **A click on the reply box can navigate away instead of focusing it.** Seen
  2026-08-10: clicking `Balas ke <handle>...` loaded a *different* post entirely. The
  tab title and URL change, so check them — if you type after that, you reply to the
  wrong person. Re-navigate to the intended post and click again, further from any
  link.
- **The viewport resizes between screenshots** (1200x656 / 1416x840 / 1486x812 all seen
  in one session). Coordinates from an earlier screenshot go stale. Re-screenshot
  immediately before any click that matters.
- **Don't batch click → type → submit.** The permission layer intermittently denies
  `type` inside a `browser_batch` while allowing it as a single call. Batching is fine
  for navigate/wait/read; step through anything that writes.
- No DM API exists, which is why Threads DMs must be browser-driven. Threads DMs route
  through Instagram's inbox for linked accounts; check both.
- Rate limits are less aggressive than Instagram's, but suppression is quiet. Logged-out
  visibility checks matter most here.

### UI labels (Indonesian)

`Terpopuler` Top · `Terbaru` Recent · `Balas` Reply · `Batal` Cancel · `Kirim` Send ·
`Utas baru` New thread · `Diposting` Posted · `Pesan` Messages · `Aktivitas` Activity

## TikTok

Verified working 2026-08-09. The test account had ~2.8k followers here versus a few dozen on Threads —
audience size does not track with which inbox is busiest.

### Loading — do not navigate straight to a search URL

Going directly to `tiktok.com/search?q=...` reliably fails: `screenshot`,
`get_page_text` and `read_page` all time out waiting for `document_idle` (45s). The tab
loads but no script can be injected.

**Drive the UI instead**, and give it time:

1. Navigate to `https://www.tiktok.com/foryou`
2. Wait ~10s. The first screenshot shows grey skeleton placeholders — that is normal,
   wait and shoot again rather than concluding it's broken.
3. Click the **`Cari`** box (top-left sidebar), type the query, press Return.

That works consistently. An early session mistook the direct-URL timeout for a hard
block — it isn't one, and no `cooldown.sh` should ever be set for it.

**Exception: `business-suite/*` URLs navigate directly and reliably.** It is the main
app (`/foryou`, `/search`, `/@handle`, `/@handle/video/...`) that needs the UI path and
patience. Those *do* eventually load — give them 15-20s and screenshot twice; the first
screenshot showing grey skeletons is normal, not a failure.

### Prospecting — poor, for two structural reasons

**1. Caption search returns sellers only.** `sewa motor bali` produced 14 results on
2026-08-09: every single one a rental business or a paid partnership. Zero buyers. Same pattern as Threads Recent, but total rather than partial.

**2. The comment intent is real but always stale.** Comments are where buyers actually
are — a single video yielded *"Syarat rental motor ap aj kak"*, *"rental dmn kak
motor"*, *"Kaka perhari brp sewa mtornya"*. But that video was posted **2025-07-24** and
those comments are from 2025-08 and 2025-09 — roughly a year old. Every result on page
one dated months back.

**There is no upload-date filter in TikTok web search** — only category tabs
(`Teratas` / `Pengguna` / `Video` / `LIVE` / `Foto`). The mobile app has one; the web UI
does not. So there is no way to reach fresh comment intent through search, and anything
found will fail the 7-day freshness rule.

**Conclusion: do not spend prospecting time here.** TikTok's value on this account is
the inbox, not search — same lesson as Instagram. Revisit only if a date filter appears
or if the account starts posting and drawing comments on its own videos.

### Comments on our own videos — verified 2026-08-09

**Do not use Business Suite for comments.** `/business-suite/comments` lists videos with
a `N komentar baru` badge, but it **never renders the comment text** — the accessibility
tree confirms it isn't in the DOM. Worse, **clicking a video clears its unread badge
immediately**, so you lose the signal without ever seeing what was asked. Clicking a
comment notification lands there too, with `video_id` and `comment_id` in the URL, and
still shows only the video plus a `Tambah komentar` box — which posts a **new top-level
comment**, not a threaded reply.

**Use this instead:**

1. **Find them:** profile → **`Aktivitas`** → filter **`Komentar`**. This lists every
   comment with its author, full text and date. `get_page_text` reads it cleanly.

   **It lists answered and unanswered comments alike** — there is no "needs reply"
   marker. Treating the list as a backlog overstates the work badly: on 2026-08-09 it
   showed ~15 items of which most already had replies. Verify on the video (step 3)
   before assuming anything is outstanding.
2. **Open the video:** `https://www.tiktok.com/@<handle>/video/<video_id>` — the
   `video_id` is in the Business Suite URL if you came from a notification. Wait ~15s.
3. **Read:** right panel → **`Komentar`** tab. Existing replies hide behind
   **`Lihat N balasan`** — always expand before replying, or you will answer twice.
4. **Reply:** click **`Jawab`** under the comment. That spawns a separate inline
   **`Tambah balasan...`** input with its own send arrow. **Click into that new input
   before typing** — typing straight after `Jawab` goes nowhere, silently.
5. **Confirm:** the comment count increments and the reply appears nested.

### Direct messages — this is what TikTok is for

DMs live in **Business Suite**, not the main app UI:

```
Messages:  https://www.tiktok.com/business-suite/messages
Comments:  https://www.tiktok.com/business-suite/comments
```

Reach it by clicking **`Pesan`** in the left sidebar. Composer is `Kirim pesan...`;
send is the **red paper-plane** at bottom-right. There's a `Hanya belum dibaca`
(unread-only) checkbox and a `Filter` dropdown.

**The unread badge lies.** "Pesan 62" sounds like 62 waiting customers. Filtering to
unread on 2026-08-09 showed almost all of them were **`Membagikan video`** — people
using TikTok's share-to-DM feature — and weeks to months old. The two genuine rental
inquiries were sitting in the **read** list, because someone had opened them, replied
once, and abandoned them.

**So do not triage by unread on TikTok.** Sort by recency and read the actual last
message. An inquiry that got one reply and then stalled is marked read and will never
resurface in an unread filter.

The `Komentar` badge behaves the same way — it counted comments on videos from January
and February, long past any useful window.

- Caption search works; filter to recent uploads.
- **The comments are where the intent is.** Open 2-3 recent popular Bali videos on the
  topic and read the comment threads. "ada yang tau sewa motor murah di canggu?" gets
  posted under someone else's video far more often than as an original post.
- Comment replies are nested — make sure you're replying to the person, not the video.
- TikTok suppresses comments containing anything link-shaped, including bare domains and
  spaced-out numbers. Plain text only.
- Loading is heavy; give pages time before deciding an element is missing.

## Instagram

- **Keyword search does not work** — it returns accounts and hashtags, not post text.
  Do not build a prospecting session around it.
- Prospecting, such as it is: hashtag pages and comments on recent Reels from Bali
  travel accounts. Low yield. Last priority.
- The most aggressive of the three about automation. Keep IG `daily_cap` lower than the
  others (default 10).

### Direct messages

Lower volume than Threads for this business (verified 2026-08-09), but the requests
folder is where leads go to die, so it still gets checked every run.

```
Inbox:            https://www.instagram.com/direct/inbox/
Requests:         https://www.instagram.com/direct/requests/
Hidden requests:  https://www.instagram.com/direct/requests/hidden/
```

Tabs: `Primary` · `General` · `From ads` · `Permintaan` (requests).

**Open `From ads` every run too — it is not optional.** Found 2026-08-11: that tab had
never been read once, and held **nine leads from paid promotion**, eight of them ending in
a bare "WA ya ka" with no number. Leads the business paid to acquire, killed by the rule-6
habit, invisible because every instruction here pointed only at `Permintaan`. `General` has
been empty both times it was checked; `From ads` is the one that hides volume.

Note `Primary` lazy-loads: the first `get_page_text` showed 6 threads, scrolling revealed
15. Don't conclude "the inbox is small" from one read.

**Always open Permintaan and Permintaan Disembunyikan.** Cold inbound from non-followers
lands there silently and is missed for weeks — the one real IG lead found on 2026-08-09
had been sitting there 9 days after handing over a phone number. Instagram even
auto-labels these: *"Kami telah mengidentifikasi prospek"*.

**Danger controls — never click:**
- **`Hapus`** / **`Delete 1`** / **`Hapus semua`** — delete, at the bottom of request lists
- **`Blokir`** — block, next to Terima on an open request
- **`Terima`** (accept) is not destructive, but it lets the sender call the account and
  see activity status. That's an account-reachability change: propose it, let the owner
  decide.

### Comments on our own posts — verified 2026-08-11

There is no Business-Suite-style aggregator. Use the notifications panel, and note it
takes **two clicks** from the home feed: the first click on the heart only expands the
sidebar and highlights `Notifikasi`, the second click on the label actually opens the
panel. (Consistent with the existing note that the heart does nothing from
`/your_activity/*` or `/direct/*` — start from the home feed.)

The panel has filter chips: `Semua` · `Orang yang Anda ikuti` · **`Komentar`** ·
`Mengikuti`. Pick `Komentar` — under `Semua`, comments are drowned in follow and like
notifications.

It is not a URL you can navigate to; it is a panel over the feed.

Reading a request does **not** notify the sender, so triage is safe. Replying requires
accepting first.

## All platforms

**Never click** delete, block, report, "discard draft?", or any control that opens a
native browser dialog. A modal freezes browser automation entirely and the session
cannot dismiss it — it needs a human at the keyboard.

**Session hygiene:** call `tabs_context_mcp` first; never reuse a tab ID from a previous
session. If a tool errors saying a tab is invalid, get fresh context rather than
guessing.

**Screenshot before submitting** any reply. The check that matters: is this the right
post, and am I logged in as the right account? Cross-brand replies are the most visible
possible failure.

**Stop after 2-3 failed attempts** on the same element. Report it and move on. Repeatedly
hammering a stuck UI is how sessions burn an hour achieving nothing.

## Chrome profiles

One profile per brand, named after the brand. This is what prevents the travel account
replying as the jastip one. `list_connected_browsers` and `select_browser` address them.

Confirm the active account in the UI at the start of every session — profile isolation
helps, but multi-account switchers inside the apps can still leave you as the wrong one.

- TODO

## Threads — `get_page_text` lies on the message-requests page (2026-08-10)

`https://www.threads.com/messages/requests` returns only the empty-state placeholder
("Pesan dari orang yang tidak Anda ikuti akan ditampilkan di sini") through
`get_page_text`, even when the folder is full. The text extractor picks up the empty
right-hand pane and misses the request list in the left column entirely.

Reading it that way says "requests folder is empty" when it holds two dozen unanswered
inquiries — the exact failure this folder already produced once. **Screenshot it.**

The same page has a red `Delete 1` control at the bottom of the column. Never click it.

## TikTok — Business Suite comments pane can mark-read without rendering (2026-08-10)

`https://www.tiktok.com/business-suite/comments` lists videos with a `N komentar baru`
count and a red dot. Clicking a row **cleared the dot and decremented the tab badge
(4 → 3) while the right-hand pane stayed blank** — it showed "Please wait..." and never
loaded. Clicking again did nothing; the row now reads "Tidak ada komentar baru".

**The unread signal is destroyed and the comment is not readable from this view.** That
is worse than a plain failure, because the surface now looks handled. If this happens,
note the video title and date before moving on — that is the only way back to it.

Fallback that day also failed: `tiktok.com/@<handle>` sat on "Please wait..." for 12s
and then became a browser error page. Both are TikTok being slow or broken, **not a
platform block** — no cooldown. Retry in a later run.

Videos with comments still pending as of 14:55 WITA 2026-08-10:
- "Jelajahi Bali dengan gaya! Vespa LX siap nemenin…" — 01/21/2026 — **badge lost to this bug**
- "Bali feels better when you move freely 🌴 Captured…" — 01/07/2026 — 1 komentar baru
- "📍Sewa Vespa LX di Bali? Gampang banget! Rent a…" — red dot

**Reproduced 15:20 the same day, and it is not a transient.** On retry the pane *did*
render — but only the video player and a `Tambah komentar…` box. **The comment list never
appears at all**, and clicking a second row cleared that badge too (3 → 2). Two unread
flags now lost this way.

So the working procedure is: **do not click rows in this view.** Use `get_page_text`
instead — it returns every video's full caption plus its `N komentar baru` state without
clicking anything, which is enough to identify which videos need attention. Then answer
them from the TikTok app (Aktivitas → Komentar), not from Business Suite.

### Working route for TikTok comments (2026-08-10, 15:50)

**Business Suite is still broken** — retested, pane blank after 16s, badge still decrements
on click. **Do not use it to read or answer comments.**

**Use the main app instead.** It was erroring earlier the same afternoon and came back:

```
tiktok.com/@<handle>  →  Aktivitas (left rail)  →  Komentar tab
```

That renders each comment's text, author and video thumbnail properly, and is the only
route confirmed to work. Business Suite remains useful for **one** thing: `get_page_text`
there returns every video's full caption plus `N komentar baru`, without clicking.

**The two surfaces disagree.** Business Suite claimed 2 videos with new comments while
the app's Komentar filter showed nothing newer than 7-19 under "Sebelumnya". Trust the
app; the Business Suite counters have already been shown to be unreliable.

## TikTok — a login modal on Business Suite is NOT a block (2026-08-10, 17:10)

At 16:47 `business-suite/messages` rendered the full **"Masuk ke TikTok"** login modal
(QR / phone / Facebook / Google / LINE, with "Terakhir dipakai" on the QR option). Read as
a login challenge under CLAUDE.md rule 4, the account was parked for 24h.

**It was a false positive.** Twenty minutes later the same URL loaded the inbox normally,
still logged in, no re-authentication done by anyone. The modal was transient — of a piece
with everything else this surface did that afternoon (comment pane blank, profile page
erroring then recovering).

**The cost was real:** the cooldown blocked a live customer who messaged during the park.

**Test before parking.** A genuine block persists; TikTok's flakiness does not. Reload the
URL once and wait ~10s before calling `cooldown.sh`. Signals that it is *not* a block:

- Another site in the same Chrome profile is still authenticated (Instagram was)
- The surface has been failing in unrelated ways the same session
- A reload clears it

A real login challenge survives a reload and usually appears on every TikTok URL, not one.

## Instagram — inbound comments, VERIFIED route (2026-08-10, 18:20)

The last unverified surface in the project. Two dead ends found first:

- `instagram.com/your_activity/interactions/comments/` lists **our own outgoing**
  comments, not inbound ones. Looks right, answers the wrong question.
- The sidebar heart does nothing from `/your_activity/*` or `/direct/*` pages.

**What works:**

```
instagram.com  →  Notifikasi (sidebar heart)  →  "Komentar" filter tab
```

It must be the **home feed** — the panel is an overlay the feed owns. On a collapsed
sidebar the first click only expands the labels; click "Notifikasi" a second time to
actually open it. Budget three clicks, not one.

The Komentar tab then shows commenter, full text and post thumbnail. First read: five
comments spanning Mar-May, all tags and compliments, none needing an answer.

Worth knowing: `hafidaslams` publicly vouched for the account in a comment —
*"yukkk sewa motornya di @motorin.bali trusted banget‼️"*. Organic advocacy like that is
worth more than anything the agent can write, and it is invisible from every other view.

## Threads — the reply composer silently drops the start of typed text (2026-08-11)

Clicking the inline `Balas ke <handle>…` box and typing immediately **lost the opening
clause**. The composer showed only the tail, and because it clips to four lines with the
cursor at the end, the truncation is invisible in the collapsed box — the visible text
looked like a complete sentence.

Caught only by expanding the composer (⤢) before submitting. The reply would have gone
out starting mid-sentence with an em-dash.

**Two rules from this:**

1. **Expand the composer (⤢) before every submit.** The collapsed box shows the last four
   lines, not the whole reply. A screenshot of the collapsed box is not verification.
2. **Focus, then type as a separate step.** The click that focuses the box swallows the
   first characters typed in the same beat.

The expanded view is also the safest place to check identity: it renders as a **"Balas"**
modal quoting the post you are replying to, with your handle beneath. If that header ever
says **"Utas baru"**, hit `Batal` — that is the original-post trap.
